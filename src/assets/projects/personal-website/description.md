## My own personal website, made via TypeScript + React

This website serves as my personal portfolio and was built using TypeScript and React. The site is hosted on Vercel (and my domain *colemanlai.com*). Some key features I was focussing on:

- Dark mode support using Tailwind CSS
  - Easy access button to switch between modes
- Responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop
- Portfolio project listing
  - Project showcase with image galleries
  - Markdown support for project descriptions
    - Using [`react-markdown`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) for content rendering
- Clean and simple navigation
- A place to showcase my origami in addition to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/12googolplex) (@12googolplex)
  - Not fully implemented yet

### Technical Implementation

The project uses several modern web technologies and practices:

- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **React** with functional components and hooks
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and dark mode implementation
- **React Router** for client-side navigation
- **React Markdown** for rendering project descriptions without the hassle of HTML
- **React Helmet** for managing SEO metadata
- **Vite** as the build tool for faster development
- **Vercel** for automated deployment
- **GitHub Copilot** for doing some of the tedious work for me

### In Progress

- Adding more projects to the portfolio
- Building the origami gallery/page(s)
- Adding my resume to the site, or at some experience section
- Updating mobile responsiveness
- Rewriting the homepage
- Currently this looks a bit simple. In the future, I want to make this look unique and themed.
