## A browser extension that adjusts YouTube video quality based on video speed

I made this as I watch a lot of YouTube videos at 2x speed while multitasking (like folding origami). This was created as a way for me to save some data and improve video playback by automatically adjusting the video quality based on the video speed.

- Speed threshold can be set for when to adjust video quality
- Quality can be set to a specific level
- Can be toggled ON/OFF

There is no styling for this extension. Deal with it. It's functional.
