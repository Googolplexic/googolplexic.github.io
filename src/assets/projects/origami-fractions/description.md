## My first actual project

A web-based tool that helps users mark fractions on square paper using origami folding techniques. Users can input any fraction, and the application will generate visual step-by-step folding sequences.

### Additional Information

This interactive application demonstrates mathematical concepts through origami. The project features:

- Two different folding methods for now:
  - Crossing Diagonals method
  - Fujimoto's Construction method
- Dynamically generated folding sequences, showing each folding step
- Automatic fraction simplification
- Step-by-step navigation controls
- Input validation to ensure valid fractions
- Some mobile responsiveness

As this was my first time working with web development, this doubled as a learning project. I learned a lot about SVG, JavaScript, and CSS during the development process. I also learned how to structure a project and manage its dependencies.
