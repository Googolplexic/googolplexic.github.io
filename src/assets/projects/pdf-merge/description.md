## A simple tool for merging PDF files on Windows

That' it. That's the project. It's a simple tool for merging PDF files on Windows. It's a Python script that uses the PyPDF2 library to merge PDF files and has a simple GUI made with tkinter.

I just made this because I needed to merge some PDFs and didn't want to use an online tool. It's not the most polished thing, but it works.
